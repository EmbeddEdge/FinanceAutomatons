# Personal Finance Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to automate personal finance tasks. These scripts accept CSV inputs and input the data into a budget tracking spreadsheet, making it easier to manage and track your finances.

## Features

- **CSV Input**: The scripts are designed to accept CSV files as input, allowing you to easily import your financial data.
- **Budget Tracking**: The scripts automatically update a budget tracking spreadsheet with the imported data, providing an overview of your income, expenses, and savings.
- **Automation**: By automating the process of inputting financial data, these scripts save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on other important tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Prepare your financial data in a CSV format, following the provided template.
3. Check the budget tracking spreadsheet to view the updated financial information.

## Long-term Goals

The idea is to create a full set of scripts that can automate as much as possible in the process of personal finance or for small businesses. 
The ideal output would be to generate monthly reports with or without suggestions that will help a person spend better in the next month.
The ideal workflow is to remove as much manual entry and error-checking as possible. 
As close to real-time is another goal so that the data can be updated weekly or possibly even on a daily basis.
